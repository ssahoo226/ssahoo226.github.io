<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics"><strong>Contact Mechanics</strong></a>
    is the study of deformation of two bodies when they are touching each other. It used in the study of tribology, contact stiffness, electrical contact resistance and indentation hardness. Heinrich Hertz is pioneer in this field who solved the contact problem and also developed it into a <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/training/course-descriptions/simpack-contact-mechanics/"><i>software CONTACT</i></a>, which provides solution a varigated set of contact problems.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2012.02.010"><strong>Hertzian Contact Theory</strong></a>
    first ever proposed theory by Hertz. It is a classical theory of contact mechanics. Even though the derivation of the theory is relatively difficult, the final solution is a set of simple analytical equations relating the properties of the system to the developed stress at the contact. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00423114.2013.826370"><strong>Creep forces modelling</strong></a>
    , the tangential frictional forces generated at the contact are termed as creep forces. When systems become more and more complex, evaluation of these forces become more complicated and time consuming, much research has been done to establish fast algorithms for their computation. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1243/0954409JRRT60"><strong>Wear Modelling</strong></a>
    , wheel and rail wear is fundamental problems, they affect stability and comfort of passengers and can also lead to derailment. Many experimental procedures have been laid for the purpose to model its different parameter evolution.

<h3>
  <strong>Investigating contact mechanics experimentally through inverse formulation using temperature monitoring</strong><br>
</h3>

<ul>
Rail wheel monitoring is an active research field all over the world. Several commercial products exist in this field. Yet much attention is needed towards developing advanced monitoring systems, which have a prognostic methodology in contrast to the traditional diagnostic approach. <!-- \autocite{alemi2017condition}.  -->Our attempt here is to develop a prognostic methodology for reducing wear and tear of wheel surface in the scenario of disc braking. 
Disc braking employed in high speed trains leads to undesirable phenonmena like wheel flats, wheel sliding, wheel locking and wheel spalling. Due to high braking torque, wheels get locked faster (1- 3 secs)<!-- \autocite{deshpande2010investigation} --> which results in higher cooling rate, thereby increasing the chances of brittle maternsitic phase transformation. 
Our aim is to predict the friction coefficient based on input from temperature sensors then use this information to set the braking limits. The development of the prediction model are as follows: 
</ul>

<ul><b>Forward problem</b>
<ul>
<li> solving the rail vehicle dynamics problem</li>
<li> solving the contact mechanics problem</li>
<li> solving the heat transfer problem</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul><b>Inverse Problem</b>
<ul>
  An inverse algorithm will be applied to the previous framed forward problem by using the state of the art technique like variational auto encoder. The model will predict the running conditions like friction coefficient at the rail wheel contact interface taking temperature as its input.
</ul> 
</ul>
<ul><b>Experimental validation</b>
  <ul>The model is then calibrated on rail wheel contact simulator. Rail wheel contact simulator is a experimental setup with two discs mounted on shafts placed in contact with each other. The two discs are profiled like wheel and rail profiles respectively.  
  </ul>
</ul>


</ul>
